        <h2 style="color: white">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p style="color: white">
            This calculator allows you to quickly and easily find out the fees or commissions when sending or receiving money through PayPal. Find out how much money you need to send so that the recipient receives the correct amount and vice versa.
        </p>

        
        <h3 style="color: white">How to use this calculator?</h3>

         <p style="color: white">
             Simply enter the amount you want to send or receive. You will automatically know the net and gross amount in detail.

             For the calculation to be accurate, it is important that you first review the <strong>commission percentage</strong>.

            If you will receive a payment from another country you can click on the corresponding flag. You also have the calculator in Spanish at your disposal.
         </p>
        
         <h3 style="color: white">What is the gross amount?</h3>

         <p style="color: white">
             It is the money sent or received without counting the PayPal commission. In other words, it is when the payer sends a certain amount and the recipient pays the commissions.
         <p style="color: white">
             For example: If they send you 50 USD gross, you will receive 48.25 USD net, discounting the commission ($ 1.75) that Paypal charges per transaction, which in this case is 3 USD.
         </p>
        
         <p style="color: white">
             The gross amount is the net amount plus commissions.
         </p>

         </p>

        <h3 style="color: white">What is the net amount?</h3>

         <p style="color: white">
             The NET amount is the money sent minus PayPal fees.
         </p>

         <p style="color: white">
           For example: If I ask for $10 net, you must send me $10.61, so that, deducting PayPal commissions ($0.61), I receive exactly $10.
         </p>
        
         <p style="color: white">
         Net is the amount left after commissions
         </p>
       
        <h3 style="color: white">How much commission does PayPal charge?</h3>

         <p style="color: white">
             The calculation of the commission depends on the currency and the country where the transaction is made. You can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/PayPal-fees?locale.x=en">read here</a> more about PayPal consumer fees.
